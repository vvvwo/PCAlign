# Python implement of paper "PCAlign A General Data Augmentation Framework for Point Clouds"

This project is A python implementation of the paper "PCAlign A General Data Augmentation Framework for Point Clouds", and the original warehouse  can be referred to https://github.com/vvvwo/PCA-based-Point-Cloud-Alignment/tree/main which is implement by c++.

To enhance comprehension of the PCAlign concept while minimizing distraction from extraneous code, we opt to directly utilize PointNet as the backbone network and implement PCAlign's data augmentation approach.

Welcome to replace PointNet with powerful backbone network to achieve optimal performance across various cloud tasks.
